<pre><strong>This is Address Book.</strong></pre>
<pre>
It stores your contacts in an array (first name, last name, phone, email).  
You can add, search, and list your contacts.

Known issues:

-At this stage, you can add as many contacts as you like, but then can only do two iterations of 'search' or 'list contacts' functions before the program resets.  

-After executing the search or list function, the menu cancel button must be pressed as many times as the contained contacts (once for search and for list as many contacts contained in the address book).  This seems to be because the 'display menu' function is inside the for loops.  

To run this program, visit: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/drumfiend21/coding-camp-repo/blob/master/addressbook.html 

And open the console to view the address book results.</pre>
