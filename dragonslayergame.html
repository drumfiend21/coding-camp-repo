<pre><strong>This is the Dragon Slayer game.</strong></pre>
<pre>
It is a simple game designed using probability, rounding, while loops, and if else.

A 50% probability determines whether the user loses the game immediately to an imaginary dragon,
or rolls the dice.

The dice roll value exceeds '4,' the dragon is slain.
Else, the coin flip iteration begins again until the user loses or dice roll damages exceed '4'.

After the user confirms to run the program, results are displayed once the program has terminated 
in a win or loss.
